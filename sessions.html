        <h1>How It Happens</h1>

        <div class="to-right">



            <p> Each session lasts 90 minutes with a 10-minute break half time. Warning! This is very intense.
                <br>After everyone has arrived, Mike or Julia, who act like the group leaders greet everyone. 
                 Karina and Brian (or just one of them) also participate but for now they stay in the background. <br>
                 Everyone in turn greet each other. First, the group returns to issues addressed in the last meeting.
                The individuals who had shared their problems previously tell about how techniques suggested by the 
                group have worked. If necessary, further suggestions are made. Brian and Karina step in, too. <br>
                Next, the group proceeds to other members' problems. Situations are described in detail, even acted out.
                We embrace crying and emotions, too! We encourage that to happen. <br>
                After this, we take a break. Next, roleplay! This is lead by Brian or Karina. Everything we heard in the first part of the session, is 
                acted out. The concerned parents will tell how they reacted and could have been better in the given situation.
                
                
                To finish the session, the group does breathing exercises. Then, the group hug! Finally, there is coffee, tea and biscuits.

            <p>Well, if you thought, that we are just sitting around, you are wrong! We organize a daytrip within Ireland 
                and a barbeque every year. We go bowling for charity, we wear Christmas jumpers and dress up for Halloween. (Of course, you don't have to.)
                These events are great for team building, and are fondly talked about by group members. You can bring your teenager, too! 
                Experience shows that they like it!
