[Confidentiality statement](https://github.com/renatalantos/Embrace-support-group/blob/master/documents/screenshots/Confidentiality_statement.JPG)


# Features

### Header

The header contains a logo of the Support group, links to the Home, About, Sessions, Gallery and Contact pages.
The header will allow the user to see all available pages at a glance and navigate between pages without having to go back to the previous pages. The header is present on all pages linked in it, except for the Confidentiality page, which is a document, not an actual webpage.


### Footer 

The footer contains a link to the Condidentiality page (statement), a link to contact a child psychologist and links to Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and Youtube pages. For visual enhancement, it displays icons over the link text. For a simpler solution, the <em>Follow us on social media</em> text is not a link, user needs to click on the icons. Hovering over them guide the user. On the <em>Confidentiality</em> and <em>Contact a child psychologist</em> links the actual text is clickable, the icons are unresponsive. Users can use the <em>Contact a child psychologist</em> link as a shortcut to get to the contact page, were his image, profile and practice's address are displayed. 



### Page main image


The main image is present on the Home, About and Sessions pages. It's function is to grab the user's attention and to enhance the groups' ethos and practices. The text overlay provides information about activity and ethos and another overlay displays an inspirational quote.

### Page information section


On the Home, About and Sessions pages, the information section is divided into a text and image area. The images enhance the content. Titles are displayed as headings.

### Testimonials section

### Slidehow image gallery

This feature is on the Gallery page. It displays one image at the time, with side buttons. The images are the size of the main images on the Home, About and Gallery pages in order to stay in keeping with the site's general layout. A slow zoomout enhances the images, and there is a friendly message to the user in the bottom right corner in a text overlay. There is also a heading on the page, which gives the main message of the page.


### Contact details section

### Radio buttons

On the Contact page, the user can let the site owners know whether he/she wants to participate in the sessions soon. Radio buttons are technically part of the contact form.

#### Discrepancies with original ideas


*  Overall 

Overall I kept to the basic layout described in the wireframes. The main discrepancy  is that I didn't implement a hamburger menu in mobile
view as planned. Also, in tablet and mobile view, the copyright message is not displayed. See Issues for explanation.

* On individual pages
  * Home page

  I added more text start with, as I felt the user would look for information on the group. I added smaller images to enhance the content and make the site visually more appealing. I divided the text area into a left and right section. The testimonials are displayed in a 2-by-2 view, instead of a 4-by-1 and used images, too to introduce the reviewers. I used Welcome instead of Intro.

    *  About page


    I added smaller images to enhance the content and make the site visually more appealing. I divided the text area into a left and right section. I used Our Group Leaders instead of History and used images, too to introduce them. I also planned to put the child psychologist contact details and image here, which are on the Contact page right now. I felt this was more logical and coherent.

    *  Sessions page 

    I added smaller images to enhance the content and make the site visually more appealing. I divided the text area into a left and right section. Also, a video is featured here, that I wanted to display in the Gallery page, as one of the images.

    *  Gallery page


    Instead of a mosaic image layout I displayed a whole page slideshow gallery. I felt this is more consistent with the layout of the previous pages that display a large size main image on top.

    *  Contact page 


    I changed the arrangements of the 3 sections on the page. The two 50% size sections are displayed in reverse order as the user will look for the contact details first according to the page title and on smaller screens the contact details might not show without scrolling down first. Also I inserted the child psychologist's details here. 


    The contact form is for newsletter subscription purposes, as opposed to the original where it was meant for contacting the site. This would have merely duplicated the contact option, without any added function.


    The radio button question has been changed to asing the user whether they would want to join soon. The original question would have been answered by the user in the process of contacting the group anyway.

    *  Confidentiality page - was meant to be the way it is in the final version.
