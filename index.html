            <h2>Welcome</h2>
            <p>Parenting teenagers can be challenging 
                and many parents find it hard to adapt to changes
                in their child's behaviour as they grow.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="middle-heading">
            <h2>Vision</h2>
            <p>We want to create a world where the hardships of parenting teenagers are acknowledged, 
                accepted and talked about and where every parent in distress will feel confident
                to openly access our support group,based on a communal understanding and willingness 
                to support each other. </p>

            <div id="testimonial top-right">
                <p>"I gained an understanding of how teenagers think and I am learning 
                    to stay calmer and have more patience with my daughter. 
                    My eyes were opened to a lot of things I was not aware of." - Maria</p>
            </div>

                     I found the sessions covered all the issues I needed so happy with everything." - Joe</p>

                <p>"Such a nice space, easy to speak up, there is no judgement. You can finally breathe.
                     Even the most difficult problems can be addressed. A big thank you to the hosts and 
                     all members of the group, you have helped me get over a very difficult time.
