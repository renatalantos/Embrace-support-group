        <h1>Our Group Leaders</h1>


        <ul id="team-founders">



            <li><img src="assets/images/member_1.jpg" alt="group_founder1">
                <p>Our group was founded in 2018 by Mike, hard-wearing father-of-4 and Julia,
                    mother of 3. The difficulties they encountered raising teenage children
                    inspired them to reach out to other parents, share and eventually embrace
                    these problems and help other parents overcome trying situations and problems.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li><img src="assets/images/member_2.jpg" alt="group_founder2">
                <p>Julia and Mike have become qualified therapists since. The group has been growing ever since,
                    and has been involving 2 mental health professionals as well, Brian and Karina.</p>
            </li>
            <li><img src="assets/images/member_3.jpg" alt="group_founder3">
                <p>Brian brings 10 years clinical experience as a Counsellor & Psychotherapist
                    for Children and Teenagers. </p>
            </li>
            <li><img src="assets/images/member_4.jpg" alt="group_founder4">
                <p>Karina holds a Masters Degree in Health Promotion
                    and a BA (Hons) Degree in Social Care. She worked in the area of homelessness
                    before moving into youth work to operate an internationally recognised
                    youth mentoring programme. </p>

        <h1>Group Therapy Benefits</h1>


        <div class="to-right">

            <p>Family life is the main factor in our quality of life. If things go wrong in this area,
                our whole life balance is owerthrown. <br>Group therapy can help parents work toward and meet many types
                of goals, like understanding their child better,
                developing better communication or knowing when it is time to ask for professional intervention.
                <br>Sometimes, group therapy is a good fit for that individual or better for treating
                their concern as they see that they are not on their own.
                Therapy groups can help parents who find it difficult to get
                through daily life. Others may not have pressing concerns but still wish for support.
                They can also benefit from group therapy. </p>
