                <p>Our group was founded in 2018 by Mike, hard-wearing father-of-4 and Julia,
                    mother of 3. The difficulties they encountered raising teenage children
                    inspired them to reach out to other parents, share and eventually embrace
                    these problems and help other parents overcome trying situations and problems.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li><img src="assets/images/member_2.jpg" alt="">
                <p>They have become qualified therapists since. The group has been growing ever since,
                    and has been involving 2 mental health professionals as well, Brian and Karina.</p>
                </li>

        <h1>Benefits</h1>


        <div class="to-right">

            <p>Group therapy can help parents work toward and meet many types of goals.
                Sometimes, the therapist might suggest group therapy over other forms of treatment.
                This could be because it is a good fit for that individual or better for treating
                their concern. Therapy groups can help parents whose problems it difficult to get
                through daily life. Others may not have pressing concerns but still wish for support.
