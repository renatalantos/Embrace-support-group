        <h1>Welcome</h1>


        <div class="to-right">

            <p>Parenting teenagers can be challenging
                and many parents find it hard to adapt to changes
                in their child's behaviour as they grow. <br>
                We are a community of experienced parents and fully qualified mental health professionals
                volunteering / charity to run a therapy support group to provide a high quality, safe,
                anonymous and confidential space for parents with teenage children to gain support,
                for whatever you are going through. <br>
                With us, you can relax, relate, share and realize that you are not on your own!
            </p>

        <h1>Vision</h1>


        <div class="to-right">

            <p>We want to create a world where the hardships of parenting teenagers are acknowledged,
                accepted and talked about and where every parent in distress will feel confident
                to openly access our support group,based on a communal understanding and willingness
                to support each other. </p>

                <p>"I gained an understanding of how teenagers think and I am learning
                    to stay calmer and have more patience with my daughter.
                    My eyes were opened to a lot of things I was not aware of." - Maria</p>

                    I found the sessions covered all the issues I needed so happy with everything." - Joe</p>
            </li>

                    all members of the group, you have helped me get over a very difficult time.
