    <div id="conf-statement" id="confidence">





        <p>Group therapy is a process which is designed to assist you in dealing with
            your concerns, coming to a greater understanding of yourself those around you, and using effective means of
            coping which utilize personal and interpersonal resources.</p><br>
        <p> This relationship usually
            involves sharing personal information with group members and therapists which may at times be sensitive,
            very
            private, or even distressing. Therefore it is not uncommon during the course of these proceedings to
            feel somewhat more anxious or upset for a time. If you should feel this way, it is important to
            share this information with your group leader. While the outcome of therapy is most often
            positive, the degree to which any particular individual will reach their goals or achieve their
            desired level of satisfaction is not predictable.</p><br>
        <p> Your privacy is important to us, and we believe that group therapy is most effective when participants
            feel comfortable speaking openly with their fellow participants and group leaders. We hope this information
            will clarify our
            privacy policies.</p><br>

        <p> In the usual course of events, you have the right to keep your participation here
            completely private.
            Without your written permission, no information about your participation is available to anyone outside
            of the group, including mental health services, family members, friends,
            or outside agencies. We do use a log to keep track of particpants' progress. </p><br>

        <p>Please ask us if you have any questions about this, as we want to be
            sure you are comfortable with our practices.</p>
